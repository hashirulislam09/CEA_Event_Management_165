# Event Management & Registration System

## Project Overview
This project is a small-scale **Event Management and Registration System** designed as part of the 
Complex Engineering Activity (CEA) for the course **Application of Information and Communication 
Technologies (AICT) - MCT-107L**.  

The system allows management of events, participant details, and registrations using a relational 
database with three tables: **Events**, **Participants**, and **Registrations**. SQL queries are used 
for data retrieval and analysis, Google Sheets is used for dataset creation, and Canva is used for 
system diagram visualization. The project demonstrates the effective use of ICT tools for organizing 
and tracking events digitally.
